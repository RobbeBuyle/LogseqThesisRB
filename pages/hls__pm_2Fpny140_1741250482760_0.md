- OSA patients are hyperalgesic because of disrupted sleep [10], which enhances sensitivity to pain, promotes inflammation, and increases spontaneous pain

- treating the sleep apnea (e.g., continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) may potentially improve pain intensity, decrease the need for opioid analgesics, and help predict a patient’s opioid sensitivity in acute care settings

- Group 1 found a significant association of OSA—or one of its constituent pathophysiologic components, such as nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), or respiratory disturbance index (RDI)—with experimental pain tolerance

- Two of the studies that measured self-reported pain intensity found that hypoxemia was associated with increased pain intensity[16,19]. Doufas et al. [16] took volunteers at risk for OSA, of which 72% turned out to have OSA after polysomnogram, and showed that nocturnal hypoxemia and the serum hypoxemia marker (IGFBP-1), but not sleep fragmentation, were associated with increased potency of the opioid remifentanil

- risk of sleep apnea (as examined by the Berlin Questionnaire, not actual polysomnography) did not correlate significantly with current pain, although poor sleep duration (more than sleep quality) increased pain intensity.

- CPAP nonadherence (as opposed to adherence) was positively associated with pain intensity; however, adherence to CPAP among the CPAPadherent patients did not decrease pain intensity during follow-up after 12 months.
