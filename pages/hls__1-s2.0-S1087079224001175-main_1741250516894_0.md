- Second, the association between night-time sleep variables and next morning pain intensity is mainly true when sleep is assessed by selfreport (which assesses the perception of sleep quality or sleep duration) instead of actigraphy, even when studies considered with a high risk of bias were excluded. This result emphasizes the impact of an individual’s beliefs in shaping his/her experienced sleep quality and related pain intensity, which objective assessments may not capture such as feelings of restfulness upon awakenin

- hile actigraphy estimates sleep parameters based on biometric data including arm movement [34], they are known to overestimate sleep and underestimate wakefulness [36]. Thus, the less frequently observed association between night-time objective sleep quality and next day (morning) pain intensity might be due to the suboptimal assessment of sleep/wake behavior by actigraphy. Polysomnography, which is the goldstandard for sleep assessment, might be more appropriate to reliably assess the day-to-day sleep-pain association

- it is impossible to ask questions about pain intensity without increasing someone’s focus on bodily symptoms and attention to pain (which in turn relates to pain intensity). Therefore, the number of ‘pain intensity’ questions per day can in itself influence the outcome of a pain intensity measure, and as such the results on the association between day-to-day sleep quality and pain intensity. This phenomenon is called assessment reactivity and forms an issue in EMA studies
