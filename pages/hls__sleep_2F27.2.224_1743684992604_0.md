- the proportion of fatigue-related accidents in police reports and accident databases from different jurisdictions varies greatly, ranging from about1% for all police-reported accidents in the United States5 to about 20% in fatal accidents in New South Wales, Australia.

- ncluding sleeping time last night into the regression model (Model 2) had a strong effect for under 6 hours (10.37 times higher than for sleep duration of 7 to 8 hours), while time-of-day effect no longer reached significance.

- In cases where the driver’s task is easy and monotonous and demands little effort, as in open-road driving in good weather and road conditions, there are reasons to assume that fatigue will be induced,

- If the task is more demanding, instead, such as entering a crossing or driving in bad road conditions, falling asleep is a much less probable explanation, and perceptual errors or loss of control are more often offered as a primary cause, although fatigue, a lapse in attention, or even falling asleep might trigger or substantially contribute to the cause.
