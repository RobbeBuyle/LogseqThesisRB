- This dangerous behaviour can be related to economic rewards (Arnold et al., 1997) in professional drivers or to socio-cultural factors (Philip et al.,1996, 1999) in vacationers.

- In the public, fatigue and sleepiness are very frequently confused. Even if their causes (heavy workload versus sleep deprivation) and counter-measures (rest versus sleep) are very different, people do not necessarily discriminate the effects and remedies to the two conditions. For instance, sleep-deprived drivers will stop more frequently but will not necessarily sleep during their breaks

- sleep-related accidents frequently happen with a single car driving off the road and hitting an obstacle with no reaction from the driver

- Between sessions, compared to the ﬁrst morning session, the risk of line crossing increased signiﬁcantly in the fourth session (15:15–17:00) in the non-restricted condition, and in the second session (11:00–12:45) in the restricted condition

- A two-way repeated ANOVA with time of day and condition indicated a signiﬁcant main effect for time of day (F(5,105) = 4.868; p < 0.01) and condition (F(1, 21) = 20.447; p < 0.001). The interaction between the two factors also reached signiﬁcance (F(5, 105) = 3.229; p < 0.05)

- Self-ratings during the breaks showed a signiﬁcant increase in perception of instantaneous fatigue between rested and sleep-restricted conditions (mean ± S.D., respectively, 31.9 ± 15.5 versus 60.5 ± 18.4; F(1, 21) = 67.791; p < 0.0001). Fatigue increased over the driving sessions(Table 2) in the rested condition (fatigue score = 24.7(S.E. = 2.4) + 2.1 (1.0) times session number from 1 to5; r = 0.19; p = 0.045) and sleep-restricted condition (fatigue score = 49.5 (3.9) + 3.7 (1.2) times session number from 1 to 5; r = 0.28; p = 0.0028). The group by driving session interaction was not signiﬁcant (F(5, 105) = 0.896; p > 0.05).

The group by driving session interaction was not signiﬁcant (F(5, 105) = 1.986; p > 0.05)

- Our study shows that rested non-professional drivers can drive from 9:00 to 19:00 (625 miles) with three 15 min breaks and one 30 min break without experiencing noticeable performance decrement, during mildly demanding (fair weather, light trafﬁc) long-distance driving. This demonstrates that fatigue generated by extensive driving has a limited impact on driving skills in normally rested drivers

- When our subjects were sleep-restricted a clear impact on driving skills was noted, from the ﬁrst driving session in the morning. Our study, therefore, highlights the fact that even for short duration of driving (1–2 h) and moderate time awake (8 h) sleep restriction can impair driving
