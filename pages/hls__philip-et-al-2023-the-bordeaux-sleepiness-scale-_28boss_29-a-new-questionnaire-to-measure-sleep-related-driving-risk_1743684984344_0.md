- xcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common symptom among the general population. 1–3 It is also a very common risk factor for car accidents, causing many deaths and injuries and carrying a high socioeconomic burden

- The AUC of the BOSS was significantly higher than that of the ESS (difference between areas = 0.100, P < .001), the ESS ≥ 11(difference between areas = 0.164, P < .001), and the ESS ≥ 16(difference between areas = 0.192, P < .001). There was no difference between the AUC of ESS ≥ 11 and ESS ≥ 16 (difference between areas = 0.028, not significant) or between the AUC of the BOSS and the AUC of the SAW (difference between areas = 0.009, not significant)

- The AUC of the BOSS was significantly higher than that of the ESS (difference between areas = 0.085, P < .001), ESS ≥ 11 (difference between areas = 0.135, P < .001), and ESS ≥ 16 (difference between areas = 0.220, P < .001). The AUC of ESS ≥ 11 was significantly higher than that of ESS ≥ 16 (difference between areas = 0.085, P < .001). The AUC of the BOSS was significantly different compared to the SAW (difference between areas = 0.017, P < .001). The latter was significantly higher than that of ESS ≥ 11 (difference between areas = 0.154, P < .001) and ESS ≥ 16 (difference between areas = 0.239, P < .001).

- This study also confirms the limitations of the ESS regarding the measurement of driving risk in nonsleepy and very sleepy drivers. The BOSS is based on driving behaviors and, unlike the ESS, does not cover nonrisky situations (eg, reading a book or watching TV)
