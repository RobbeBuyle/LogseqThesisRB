- This study seeks to analyse the extent to which sleep-related variables contribute to the risk of automobile accidents. Although sleepiness and fatigue are widely accepted to play a major role, the addition of objective data and advanced machine learning algorithms in this study aims to shed light on this complex relationship. A predictive model will be developed using machine learning techniques that integrate both subjective and objective sleep data. It's predictive performance and feature importance will be evaluated across algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and Support Vector Machines). Data obtained from [n = ...] drivers (40 years and older) who participated in the first visit of the multi-center cohort Sleep Heart health Study will be analysed.
