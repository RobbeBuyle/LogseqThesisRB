- Insomnia, on the other hand, is the most common sleep disorder which manifests as a subjective complaint in initiating, maintaining sleep, and/or waking up sooner than desired. In addition, at least one daytime impairment must be present (e.g., concentration difficulties, mood swings, malaise, sleepiness, or fatigue). Insomnia becomes chronic when it persists for at least three months and occurs at least three nights a week [ 1, 5– 7]

- Although a reciprocal relationship between pain and sleep seems well accepted [8– 11 ], multiple studies consider disturbed sleep a better predictor of pain than vice versa [ 2,8 –12 ].
