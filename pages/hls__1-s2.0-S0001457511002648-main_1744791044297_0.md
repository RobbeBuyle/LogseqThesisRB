- factors that contribute to fatigue include: time of day (or circadian phase; Colquhoun, 1971), prior wake (Dinges and Kribbs, 1991), sleep dose (Belenky et al., 2003), and task-related factors (Richter et al., 2005).0001-4575/$ – see front matter © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

- it can be seen that performance was worst after the circadian nadir (60◦) which coincides with the early morning hours under normal entrainment, while performance was best at the circadian peak (180◦) which corresponds with early evening hours

- The inﬂuences of prior wake and circadian position were both present on Day1 and Day 7 (Fig. 2D and F), but on Day 7 (with high sleep debt) the effects of prior wake and circadian position were more pronounced

- The ﬁndings suggest that the presence of the time of day inﬂuence on driving performance (under this short task duration) is dependent on the length of prior wake or the presence of sleep debt

- Driving performance is worse due to the effect of sleep restriction, but in addition, the effect of increasing prior wake on driving performance becomes larger, the time of day effect becomes larger, and ﬁnally the three-way interaction term adds a compounding effect in addition to these others

- It follows then that the change in performance associated with this interaction (22 h of prior wake at the circadian nadir) equates to driving performance seen in individuals that have BACs of between.05% and .08%, which is dangerous in the real world.
