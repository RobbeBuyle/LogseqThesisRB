- Road traﬃc injuries are currently estimated to be the ninth leading cause of death across all age groups globally, and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2,030(World Health Organization, 2018).

- The correlation between OSA and motor vehicle accidents is conﬁrmed by several studies reporting an increasing risk varying between two and seven-fold in comparison to the general population (McNicholas and Rodenstein, 2015). Motor vehicle crashes are more frequent in untreated patients and usually associated with more severe injuries (Mulgrew et al.,2008; Garbarino et al., 2016a). Regular CPAP treatment relieves excessive daytime sleepiness and reduces the crash ris

- However, it is a matter of discussion (McNicholas and Rodenstein, 2015) whether the driving risk in OSA is more closely related to the degree of daytime sleepiness or to the objective severity of sleep-disordered breathing. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in usually reported only by 30–50% of OSA patients

- Overall, patients with NMAs showed higher severity of OSA, both in terms of AHI and nocturnal hypoxia, higher sleep fragmentation, clinical symptoms including higher score of Epworth Sleepiness scale. The association between OSA and increased risk of motor vehicle crash was the aim of a systematic review and meta-analysis by Tregear et al. (2010).
