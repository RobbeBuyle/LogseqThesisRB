- According to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of more than440,000 adults nationwide, 35% of U.S. adults usually sleep for less than 7 hours daily, including 12% who report usually sleeping for 5 hours or less (Liu et al., 2016). In any given24-hour period from 2005 through 2014, an estimated 18% of all U.S. residents aged 16 and older slept for less than 7 hours, including 1.6% who slept for less than 4 hours and 0.3% who slept for less than 2 hours (American Time Use Survey, 2015, unpublished analysis by author)

Odds ratios associated with usually sleeping for less than 4 hours, 5-6 hours, and 6-7 hours daily were not statistically significant.

- Results showed that drivers who had slept for fewer than 7 hours in the past 24 hours had significantly elevated crash rates compared with drivers who had slept for 7 hours or more. Drivers who usually slept for between 4 and 5 hours daily were also found to have significantly elevated rates of crash involvement compared with drivers who usually sleep for 7 hours or more, and drivers who had slept for 1 or more hours less than their own usual amount in the past 24 hours also had significantly elevated crash rates independent of how much they usually slept.

- By way of comparison to another widely-acknowledged traffic safety problem—driving while impaired by alcohol—two large case-control studies by the NHTSA of the relationship between a driver’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and the relative risk of crash involvement have estimated the risk of crash involvement at a BAC of 0.08 compared with a BAC of 0.00 is approximately 2.7 – 3.9 (Blomberg et al., 2005; Compton & Berning, 2015). Thus, this study’s estimate of the crash risk associated with driving after having slept for 45 hours in the past 24 hours compared with 7 hours or more is similar to the NHTSA’s estimates of the crash risk associated with driving with a BAC equal to the level that all U.S. states have set as the per se legal limit, and the crash risk associated with having slept for less than 4 hours is comparable to the crash risk associated with a BAC of roughly0.12 – 0.15 as estimated by Blomberg et al. (2005) and Compton & Berning (2015).

- performance after 17 hours of continuous wakefulness was similar to performance at a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05 and performance after 24 hours continuously awake was similar to performance at a BAC of 0.10 (Dawson & Reid, 1997). Another study that used simulated driving found that drivers’ variability in speed and lane position were similar after 18.5 hours awake to at a BAC of 0.05, and similar after 21 hours9

- t should be noted that crashes examined in this study were more severe than average, because this study was based on analysis of data from a sample of crashes in which EMS was dispatched and at least one light vehicle was towed due to damage. Police reported that at least one person was injured in 77% of crashes in the study sample. By way of comparison, only 28% of all police-reported crashes nationwide in 2015 resulted in any reported injuries
