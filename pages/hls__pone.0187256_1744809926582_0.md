- ccording to a recent meta-analysis, in insomniac patients, the risk of work injuries is more than double (Odds ratio OR = 2.87) [14]. This figure is similar to the cumulated odds for OSA patients (OR = 2.88). Insomnia and OSA are the two most common sleep disorders, found respectively in 6–20% and 23–50% of the general population [15,16]. Frequently these disorders are also concurrent, with 39–58% of OSA patients reporting symptoms indicative of co-morbid insomnia [15]. The prevalence of insomniac drivers ranges from 9.3% in regular registered highway car drivers [17] to 26% among older male car drivers who have already had a driving accident
