- These results revealed an initial higher probability to report a collision for females aged 18–29 years, compared to other gender × age groups (8.2% vs.2.3–4.3%). By year 3, males aged 18–29 years exhibited a similar cumulative probability to young females group, and both groups were at greater risk of a road collision than older groups from year 3 to year 5. However, a comparison between the two survival curves(males vs. females, both aged 18–29) failed to reach significance, log-rank test X2(1) = 0.56, p = .46. Males and females older than30 years of age had a similar probability to report a road collision throughout the 5-year follow-up, log-rank test X2(4) = 4.31, p = .23

- For 264 collisions (60.6%), insomnia was judged to not be contributive at all, for 75 accidents (17.2%) insomnia or some of its daytime consequences was judged to be at least 50% responsible, and for the remaining 97 accidents, insomnia was estimated to play a role somewhere between 0% and 50%. Thus, insomnia or some of its associated daytime impairments was perceived to have played some contributory role in nearly 40% of the collisions
