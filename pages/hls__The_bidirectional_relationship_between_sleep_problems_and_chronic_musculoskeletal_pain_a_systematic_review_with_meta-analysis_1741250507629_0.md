- Based on the pooled results obtained in 3 studies, 12,13,37 sleep problems at baseline may increase the risk of CMP at follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 1.64, 95% CI1.01-2.65, 95% PI 0.57-4.26, GRADE: very low certainty)

- s in this review, they also found an association between sleep problems at baseline and future CMP but also an association for the other direction. The latter is different to this review where only an association in the short term was found.

- Future studies should use methods such as directed acyclic graphics (DAGs) to make the underlying assumptions on variable interactions transparent and to clearly outline the reasoning for covariate adjustments. 65 Ideally, DAGs and set of confounders should be specified in a protocol or analysis plan before registration
