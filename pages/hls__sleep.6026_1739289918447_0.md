- it is well established that arousal as well as pain thresholds are elevated during SWS. Central pain and sleep neural pathways likely overlap and interact. Although the neurophysiological mechanisms relating pain and sleep are not well defined, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that habituation to pain stimuli involves thalamic structures
