- Sleep and pain exhibit a bidirectional relationship, wherein pain disrupts sleep continuity and quality, while insufficient or disrupted sleep can heighten pain perception and sensitivity. [[20]] [[21]] [[25]] [[3]]. This reciprocal relationship has been documented across numerous studies investigating various pain conditions.
- including back pain [[11]] [[27]], lower back pain [[28]], headaches [[30]], musculoskeletal pain [[25]] [[26]] [[27]] , and chronic post-surgical pain.
- TODO sleep problems (prevalentie [[11]] , belang, vormen, ...)
	- Sleep is a complex behavioral and physiological process that enables an individual to perceptually disengage from the external environment to a certain extent [[31]] . It is believed to play a critical role in memory consolidation, performance, learning, emotional modulation and physical as well as psychological recuperation. [[Source to be linked]].
	- Consequently,
	- Sleep problems are thought to have a substantial global presence. Regarding insufficient sleep, it is estimated that 10,6% to 35.1% of the U.S. citizens sleeps fewer than 6 hours per night [[32]]. However, methodological variations and the reliance on self-reported data complicate the accurate estimation of population prevalence. Insomnia, considered to be the most common sleep problem [[Source to be linked]], is approximated to affect 10% to 20% of the adult population

- TODO pain (prevalentie, belang, vormen)
	- It is difficult to overestimate the burden of chronic
	  pain, which is defined by the International Association
	  for the Study of Pain (IASP) as an unpleasant
	  sensory and emotional experience associated with, or
	  resembling that associated with, actual or potential
	  tissue damage.1 Pain is the main reason why people
	  seek medical care, with three of the top ten reasons
	  being osteoarthritis, back pain, and headaches
