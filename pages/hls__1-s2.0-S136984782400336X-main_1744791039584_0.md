- The percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS) indicates the proportion of a one-minute interval during which an eyelid covers more than 80 % of the pupil. PERCLOS is linked to sleepiness, reduced alertness, and psychomotor performance, as well as lane departures and collisions in sleep-deprived drivers during simulated driving sessions (Alvaro et al., 2016; Caponecchia and Williamson, 2018; W¨orle et al., 2021; Jackson et al., 2016).

- A frequently put forth argument is that the resolution to any human error in driving would be to automate the driving activity entirely (Fisher et al., 2016; W¨orle et al., 2021; Othman, 2023). Previous studies have indicated that a period of inactivity in an automated vehicle (AV) for approximately 15 to 20 min can have an adverse impact on the degree of driver task engagement and alertness, which are necessary to regain control during takeover requests (Mahajan et al., 2021b, 2021a; W¨orle et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2019). At advanced levels of automation, drivers of Level-4 automated vehicles will be granted the opportunity to even doze off for a designated portion of the drive (W¨orle et al., 2021; Tomzig et al., 2024). Therefore, further research should focus on determining the optimal takeover time for future automated driving conditions, monitoring the drivers’ state of alertness continuously, and examining the availability for takeovers during various phases of sleep for sleep deprived subjects.
