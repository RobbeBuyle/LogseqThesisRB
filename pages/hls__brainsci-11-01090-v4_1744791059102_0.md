- Some authors hypothesized that older adults try to selfregulate their driving [ 2]. In other words, they avoid driving in high-risk settings, e.g., peak trafﬁc times and dark conditions (e.g., [ 28, 29 ]), which may contribute to reducing the consequences of their EDS and poor sleep quality

- Older good sleepers and older insomniacs did not differ in driving performance and driving-related skills, as well as in PVT performance. Reaction times at the PVT differed only between morning and evening performance [39 ]. Indeed, mean reaction time in the PVT was faster in the morning than the evening in controls, but not in subjects with insomnia

For the older drivers, no correlation was found between any type of running-off the road errors and vigilance level assessed through the alpha power, whatever the lighted conditions

- EEG power activity increased across the nine 5-min bins. In particular, alpha and sigma power (8–14 Hz) showed an increase. A main effect of age was observed for higher frequency band (12–32 Hz) that being increased during both conditions in older drivers. Age differences became bigger at the end of the night. Indeed, older drivers showed increased power in the frequency 10–16 Hz. Moreover, the sigma 1 band (12–14 Hz) increased across the time and was higher in older adults

- After normal sleep, no difference between groups was found. Following sleep restriction, both groups had more driving accidents. A time effect was also observed: both age groups increased the number of incidents during the task. Moreover, in this condition, the younger group showed signiﬁcantly more sleepiness-related incidents during driving simulation. Partly according to Campagne et al. [32 ], alpha and theta (4–11 Hz) EEG power was higher in younger drivers than older drivers. Consistently, subjective sleepiness (KSS) positively correlated with EEG measures after sleep restriction in both groups
