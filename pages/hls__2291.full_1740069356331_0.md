- outside of the laboratory setting, we similarly show that even modest nightly changes in sleep quality (increases and decreases) within an individual determine consequential day-to-day changes in experienced pain (decreases and increases, respectively).

- In contrast, higher-order evaluative regions of the insula, cingulate, and NAcc that play a role in the gating, integration, and relief from classification of pain signals, would conversely fail to appropriately modulate pain following sleep loss, evidenced by a reduction in activity.

- Consistent with the hypothesis, the standardized thermal pain threshold assessment (performed outside of the MRI scanner) demonstrated a significant impact of sleep deprivation on pain processing. Specifically, sleep loss expanded the temperature range for classifying a stimulus as painful through a lowering of pain threshold, such that sleep-deprived participants registered pain at a significantly lower temperature than when sleep-rested
