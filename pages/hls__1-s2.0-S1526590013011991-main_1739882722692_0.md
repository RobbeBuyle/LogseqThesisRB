- The steadily emergent view supported by those reviews has been that pain and sleep are reciprocally related and that acute experimentally induced sleep loss increases pain sensitivity. However, early evidence informing those views was limited by methodologic inconsistencies across a relatively small number of studies, and newer data suggest that a more complex and textured characterization is warranted.

- Together, these prospective studies indicate that sleep disturbance increases the risk for new-onset cases of chronic pain in pain-free individuals, worsens the long-term prognosis of existing headache and chronic musculoskeletal pain, and inﬂuences daily ﬂuctuations in clinical pain. Furthermore, good sleep appears to improve the long-term prognosis of individuals with tension-type headache, migraine, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.
