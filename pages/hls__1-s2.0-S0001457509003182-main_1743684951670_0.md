- Short-sleep duration/sleep deprivation is common in shift and night workers, and as a consequence they are more likely to be at higher risk for experiencing increased fatigue than daytime workers and the unemployed

- Distinctly different 24 h patterns were evident when categorized by driver age. Young (18–24 years, Fig. 1A) and middle-aged (25–44 years, Fig. 1B) drivers experienced peak number of nodding-off crashes nocturnally, ∼2:30–3:30 a.m., while older drivers (≥64 years, Fig. 1D) experienced peak number of such crashes during the day, ∼2 p.m.

The self-reported number of driving-off-road incidents was signiﬁcantly greater in the OSAS group, and the variables associated with this increased risk were: self-reported sleepiness while driving(OR = 5, 95% CI: 2.3-10.9), having quit driving because of sleepiness (OR = 3, 95% CI: 1.1-8.6), and currently working (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1–7.7)

HDS cases showed a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence of respiratory sleep disorders than controls.

- Indeed, medications have been shown to play a role in road crashes of professional drivers, including ones having OSAS. Howard et al. (2004) used a questionnaire to assess the relationship between driving incidents and excessive sleepiness, sleep-disordered breathing, and medication consumption in a random sample of Australian commercial drivers (n = 2342 respondents) and an additional group (n = 161) of commercial drivers who had undergone polysomnography
