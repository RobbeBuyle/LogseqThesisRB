- erotoninergic pathways are also implicated in shared modulatory mechanisms of pain and sleep regulations. Serotonin is critical for topdown orchestration of endogenous analgesia36 as well as of circadian rhythm control.37 Serotoninergic dysfunction can result in altered patterns of circadian behavior or even contribute to a disruption of sleep-wake homeostasis37 along with dysfunctional endogenous analgesia

- In a successful trial of CBT-I in people with chronic pain, improvers not only showed a significant increase in perceived sleep efficiency but also a decrease in self-reported levels of distress,57 suggesting that effective coping with stress is a key factor for sleep improvements.

- In case of suspected insomnia the physical therapists should refer the patient to a sleep physician who can use polysomnography to ascertain whether underlying primary sleep disorders are present.6,60 Such primary sleep disorders include sleep-related breathing or movement disorders, circadian sleep-wake disorders, etc. The polysomnography is not used to diagnose insomnia, but to rule out other sleep disorders.

- Whether the patient has been or is currently a substance abuser is not only important because of its potentially negative impact on biological functions of sleep, but also because past or current substance abusers’ dopaminergic circuits may be altered as a consequence of repeated activations associated with consumption

- CBT-I results in improvements in various sleep parameters (eg, self-reported sleep onset latency, time spent awake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality), sleep and pain interference with daily functioning in people with chronic pain.5,68,69 Improvements were maintained at the 3-month follow-up.68 The clinical relevance of the treatment effects was emphasized by the large difference between group responders (78% in the CBT-I-group vs 22% in the control group) and nonresponders (42% vs 11%).5 The effect sizes varied from moderate to large for sleep parameters and pain interference, but were small for pain intensity.
