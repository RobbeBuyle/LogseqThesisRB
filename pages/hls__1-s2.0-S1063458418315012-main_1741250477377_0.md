- Due to the bidirectional relationship between pain and insomnia, the ESI alone for people with OA or LBP may prove to be limited in improving pain symptoms. In our review, the efﬁcacy of combining ﬁrst line treatments for insomnia with ﬁrst line treatment for OA or LBP is not known as this has not been evaluated in any trial. We propose that the combination of ESI with guideline endorsed musculoskeletal pain interventions may compound their beneﬁcial effects on sleep and pain.
