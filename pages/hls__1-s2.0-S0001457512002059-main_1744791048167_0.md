- These types of accidents do not appear to be solely due to the driver falling asleep at the wheel, as laboratory studies have demonstrated that brief sleep episodes do not fully account for all of the performance decrements evident in sleep-deprived individuals

- Driver inattention has been identiﬁed as one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents (Treat et al., 1977). Low scores on attention and vigilance tasks are associated with higher crashrisk rates and on-road driving performance

- A number of tasks that tap into executive functions have been found to correlate with driving skills (Lundqvist, 2001; Daigneault et al., 2002; Szlyk et al., 2002; Ramaekers et al., 2006a,b). The frontal cortex is largely thought to control attention and executive function and is vulnerable to even a single night of sleep deprivation, as demonstrated in neuroimaging studies (Drummond et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2011). Conditions that impair frontal lobe functioning, such as sleep deprivation and aging, may negatively impact on driving performance.

- The PVT was the only task responding signiﬁcantly to sleep deprivation that was related to driving performance. PVT lapses(RTs > 500 ms) signiﬁcantly predicted variability in lane position(F(1, 14) = 5.10; p < 0.05; Fig. 1). PVT median RT (F(1, 14) = 11.53; p < 0.005), and PVT fastest 10% of RT (F(1, 14) = 6.37; p < 0.05) predicted a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in speed variations(Fig. 2). PVT lapses (RTs > 500 ms) explained 9.9% of the variability in lane position. PVT median RT predicted 40% of the variance in speed variations, and PVT fastest 10% of RT predicted 28% of the variance in speed variations

- The main ﬁnding of this study was that measures of psychomotor vigilance explained a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in simulated driving performance changes observed following sleep deprivation, suggesting that vigilance is a key component of drowsy driving impairments
