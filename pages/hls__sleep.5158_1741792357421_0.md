- However, there was significant heterogeneity across the studies. A sensitivity analysis identified 2 studies, Barsevick et al.51 and Garland et al.,45 as potential sources of the heterogeneity. By omitting these studies from the analysis, I 2 reduced from 84% to 31% and the overall effect of sleep treatment on sleep quality decreased from 0.78 to 0.68.

- A handful of daily process studies with chronic pain patients have revealed that nights of better sleep quality predict less attention to pain, reports of lower pain intensity in the first half of the next day, higher level of physical activity in the second half of the day, and reports of great pain in the evening.
