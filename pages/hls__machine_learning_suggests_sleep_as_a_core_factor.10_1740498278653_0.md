- sleep problems appeared 638 and 439 times among the most important characteristics in 1000 cross-validation runs where patients were assigned to the 2 extreme pain phenotype clusters

- This research may gain new momentum from discoveries such as the glymphatic system and its function in the clearance of cellular waste products from the brain, 72 with sleep possibly being an important facilitator in the process. 1
