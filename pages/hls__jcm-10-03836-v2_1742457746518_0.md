- There is growing evidence that the neurobiology of chronic pain shows overlapping mechanisms with sleep problems, which may explain the often established bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and sleep problems in people with ﬁbromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and chronic low back pain (CLBP) among others

Similarly, no signiﬁcant association between sleep quality and pain duration (>1 year vs. ≤1 year [ 54]; >11 years vs. ≤11 years [43]) was reported, although a signiﬁcantly worse daytime dysfunction sub-score of the PSQI was found if the pain duration was more than eleven years [43]

- There was one study that reported signiﬁcantly higher odds of CLBP in people with a shorter sleep duration (<5 h vs. ≥6 to <7 h; ≥5 h to <6 h vs. ≥6 to <7 h) [57 ]. In addition, a signiﬁcant decrease in odds of CLBP was found for a sleep duration of 7 to8 h per night compared to the reference sleep duration of 6 to 7 h

- In summary, weak to moderate evidence was found for a correlation between sleep parameters and pain intensity, indicating that higher pain intensity levels are correlated with poorer sleep quality (SoC 2 in CLBP; SoC 3 in CNP), more severe insomnia symptoms(SoC 2 in CLBP; SoC 3 in CNP), more severe sleep disturbance (SoC 3 in CLBP), shorter sleep duration (SoC 3 in CSP), worse objective actigraphy-derived sleep parameters ( SoC 3 in CLBP), and higher sleepiness (SoC 3 in CLBP) in patients reporting CS

- particularly in individuals with CLBP, weak to moderate evidence was found for the following associations with sleep parameters: higher odds of CLBP were obtained in patients with more severe insomnia symptoms, shorter sleep duration, and poorer sleep sufﬁciency (SoC 3)

- Moreover, higher odds were found for poor sleep quality and sleep disturbances in patients with CLBP compared to healthy controls (SoC 3). Proof for an association between CNP and sleep is limited to weak evidence for higher odds of sleep problems in patients with chronic whiplash associated disorder (SoC 3).

- Weak to moderate evidence was found for the absence of a correlation between sleep quality (SoC 2 in CLBP) or insomnia severity (SoC 3 in CLBP; SoC 3 in CNP) and pain duration. However, contrary to the aforementioned ﬁndings, weak evidence was present for a negative correlation between pain duration and severity of insomnia or sleepiness in CLBP patients (SoC 3).

- Weak evidence was present for higher CLBP pain levels at follow-up in patients reporting having problems with sleep (SoC 3).
