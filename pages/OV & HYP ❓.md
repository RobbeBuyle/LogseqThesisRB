# OV
- OV1: Which sleep-related factors influence the risk of automobile-accidents?
- OV2: To what extent can machine learning algorithms predict the occurrence of motor vehicle accidents based on sleep-related variables, and which of these variables contribute most significantly to the predictive model?
- # HYP
- HYP1: The final ML model will achieve higher average accuracy than the binary predictor of having ever fallen asleep while driving.
- HYP2: Following the promising performance of the BOSS-scale, item 4 & item 8 of the ESS will have a high predictive value in the final ML model.
- HYP3: An increase in OSA severity, as quantified by a higher Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), will not appear to be associated with a greater risk of motor vehicle accidents
- HYP4: Objective TST (PSG data) will be a significant predictor for automobile accidents
