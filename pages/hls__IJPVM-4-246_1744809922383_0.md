- It has been estimated that in the USA 56,000 accidents a year are related to inadequate sleep.[32] In the UK, 20% of highway accidents and up to one quarter of fatal and serious accidents are known to have occurred because of driver fatigue.[20,33] In Australia, it has been shown that driver fatigue is responsible for17% of all accidents, 30% of which resulted in deaths.[34,35] In 2010, 41% of a sample of U.S. drivers who responded to a telephone survey admitted to having “fallen asleep or nodded off ” at the wheel.[36] In general, fatigue is reported by Brazilian drivers to be the cause of approximately20% of the accidents and over 30% of the 24,000 deaths that occur annually on Brazilian highways. In 2008, the Brazilian Federal Highway Police reported that nearly 2,400 accidents had been caused by sleep problems.

- In one study it was found that, compared to a group without OSA (AHI = 0 to 5), patients with OSA had a greater relative risk of having an accident (1.6 to 2.9), and a greater rate of having an accident in which there was a personal injury (3.0 to 4.8). It was found further that the increase in the risks and rates of accidents was proportional to the seriousness of sleep apnea
