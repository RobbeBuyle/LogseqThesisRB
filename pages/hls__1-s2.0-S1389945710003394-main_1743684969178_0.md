- There was a substantial ordered relationship between the ESS score and the risk of sleepy driving accidents. Drivers who reported needing to stop driving because of severe sleepiness at the wheel had a 9.48-fold increase (95% CI, 4.14–21.72, p < .001) in the rate of sleepy driving accidents. Of particular note was the high risk of sleepy accidents associated with narcolepsy and hypersomnia (Odds ratio 8.78 [95% CI, 1.97–39.06, p < .01]), OSAS (Odds ratio 2.09 [95% CI, 1.06–4.13, p < .05]) and insomnia (Odds ratio1.78 [95% CI, 1.01–3.14, p < .05])
