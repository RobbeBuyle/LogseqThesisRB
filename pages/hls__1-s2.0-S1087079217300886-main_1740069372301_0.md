- It is thought that the effects of sleep problems on pain responses are mediated by impaired immunity, elevated inﬂammatory responses and raised cytokines levels such as those assessed by studies considered in this review, namely IL-6, CRP, and cortisol [30,31]. However, their meditational roles are yet to be veriﬁed in the general population whereby sleep disruptions and pain symptoms are assessed in a more naturalist way with ecological validity
