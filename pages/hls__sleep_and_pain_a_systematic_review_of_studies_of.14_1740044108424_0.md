- In a more recent overview, Nijs et al16 draw attention to the potentially inﬂuential role of serotoninergic pathways and, drawing on data from experimental (largely preclinical) research, the potential importance of relationships between sleep deprivation (along with severe and/or chronic stress), abnormal glial activation, and(neuro)inﬂammation, 15 altered levels of circulating proinﬂammatory cytokines (eg, TNFα, IL-6) 68,69 and the onset or persistence of hyperalgesia and central sensitization
