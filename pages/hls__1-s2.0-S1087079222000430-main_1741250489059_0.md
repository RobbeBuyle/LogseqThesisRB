- Since chronic pain is difﬁcult and costly to treat, and the available pharmacological treatments for the prevention of CPSP have shown underwhelming results, the identiﬁcation of modiﬁable risk factors is necessary to develop better prevention and risk reduction strategies

- genetic predisposition [7,8], female sex, younger age, preoperative pain, previous chronic pain [5], psychosocial factors [9e12], duration of surgery [2,13], surgical technique [14] and severity and duration of acute postsurgical pain[15e17].

- leep and pain have a bidirectional relationship [25,26], with pain leading to sleep disturbances [27,28], and sleep disturbances contributing to increased pain

- The presence of pain was assessed as having a pain intensity 3 (one study), 4 (one study) or >5 (one study) measured using a Numeric rating scale, or 4 as measured by the pain severity subscale of the Brief pain inventory (one study).

- This meta-analysis detected a signiﬁcant weak effect of sleep disturbances and disorders on CPSP, with an estimate of r ¼ 0.13(95% CI 0.06e0.20; p < .01)

- Interestingly, mood is another possible mediator of the association between sleep and pain. Indeed, sleep quality predicts nextday mood [87,88], and negative mood increases self-reported pain, decreases pain tolerance [89], and alters pain responses[90]

- Other evidence suggests that sleep disturbances impact pain interference through negative affect (i.e., the extent to which a person experiences subjective distress, unpleasant engagement, and emotional pain [92]) in adults and older patients [93], as well as in children with sickle cell disease [94] and chronic pain [95].

- In fact, in the multivariable models that included depression, the association between sleep disturbances, sleep disorders, and CPSP or opioid use at follow-up was signiﬁcant in ﬁve studies
