- ## Prevalence/ impact
- The societal and economical burden of sleep-related motor vehicle accidents (MVA) is both significant and underrecognized. [[7]] The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that roughly 100 000 road incidents occur annually around the globe due to driver sleepiness. [[21]] In the US, drowsiness while driving has an estimated annual cost of 12.4 billion dollars [[2]]
- However, it is believed that these figures are underreported underreported due to the absence of a standardised method and unspecified training for police officers to identify such types of crashes, which means the true extent of the problem may be even greater. [[28]] [[21]]
- Moreover, MVAs are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and are projected to rank as the fourth leading cause of death globally by 2030. [[3]] Given that approximately 10-33% of fatal MVAs in the US are related to sleep-related incidents [[3]] , in addition to sleep-induced crashes tending to have more severe or fatal consequence [[21]], it is crucial to better understand this relationship. [[18]] [[2]]
- ## Sleep related causes for automobile accidents
- Current literature indicates that sleep related factors contribute to MVAs in two major ways. Firstly, driving performance is significantly reduced when a persons sleep has been affected. Driving simulators are often used to evaluate driving performance in a controlled and safe environment [[21]] . Participants exhibit a significant increase in lateral lane deviations when sleep-deprived [[23]], a measure considered one of the most sensitive and important indicators of impaired driving performance under sleep deprivation [[21]][[15]]. Moreover, [[23]] found that psychomotor vigilance (PVT) was significantly impacted by sleep loss, which in turn significantly predicted certain components of simulated driving performance. Indeed, PVT lapses accounted for 9.9% of the variability in lane position, while 40% and 28% of the variance in speed variations could be predicted by PVT median RT and PVT fastest 10% accordingly. As a result, vigilance may play a crucial role in the decline of driving performance. Furthermore, a slower simulated braking response and more dangerous manoeuvers have also been observed in sleep deprived individuals. [[21]] [[22]] [[23]] Unfitting speed management has also been detected, with a significant increase in speed variability and mean speed. Interestingly, ... found that  sleep deprived individuals regularly tend to drive more slowly, presumably to compensate for their reduced vigilance. [[21]] An in-vivo experiment conducted by [[24]] yielded similar results. Sleep restriction resulted in significantly more interference from a co-pilot and inappropriate line crossings.
