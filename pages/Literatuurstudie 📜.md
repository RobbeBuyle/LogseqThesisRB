- ## Prevalence/ impact
- The societal and economical burden of sleep-related motor vehicle accidents (MVA) is both significant and underrecognized. [[7]] The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that roughly 100 000 road incidents occur annually around the globe due to driver sleepiness. [[21]] In the US, drowsiness while driving has an estimated annual cost of 12.4 billion dollars [[2]]
- However, it is believed that these figures are underreported underreported due to the absence of a standardised method and unspecified training for police officers to identify such types of crashes, which means the true extent of the problem may be even greater. [[28]] [[21]]
- Moreover, MVAs are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and are projected to rank as the fourth leading cause of death globally by 2030. [[3]] Given that approximately 10-33% of fatal MVAs in the US are related to sleep-related incidents [[3]] , in addition to sleep-induced crashes tending to have more severe or fatal consequence [[21]], it is crucial to better understand this relationship. [[18]] [[2]]
- ## Sleep related causes for automobile accidents
- Current literature indicates that sleep related factors contribute to MVAs in two major ways. Firstly, driving performance is significantly reduced when a persons sleep has been affected. Driving simulators are often used to evaluate driving performance in a controlled and safe environment [[21]] . Participants exhibit a significant increase in lateral lane deviations when sleep-deprived [[23]], a measure considered one of the most sensitive and important indicators of impaired driving performance under sleep deprivation [[21]][[15]]. Moreover, [[23]] found that psychomotor vigilance (PVT) was significantly impacted by sleep loss, which in turn significantly predicted certain components of simulated driving performance. Indeed, PVT lapses accounted for 9.9% of the variability in lane position, while 40% and 28% of the variance in speed variations could be predicted by PVT median RT and PVT fastest 10% accordingly. As a result, vigilance may play a crucial role in the decline of driving performance. Furthermore, a slower simulated braking response and more dangerous manoeuvers have also been observed in sleep deprived individuals. [[21]] [[22]] [[23]] Unfitting speed management has also been detected, with a significant increase in speed variability and mean speed. Interestingly, ... found that  sleep deprived individuals regularly tend to drive more slowly, presumably to compensate for their reduced vigilance. [[21]] An in-vivo experiment conducted by [[24]] yielded similar results, as sleep restriction resulted in significantly more interference from a co-pilot and inappropriate line crossings.
- Secondly, falling asleep at the wheel has been identified as a significant contributor to sleep-related MVAs. In a survey conducted by The European Sleep Research Society in 19 different European countries, 17% of participants fell asleep at the wheel at least once within 2 years. [[36]] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported a lifetime prevalence rate of 37% for individuals who have ever fallen asleep or nodded off at the wheel, according to a 2002 survey. [[37]] Given the substantial advancements in driver monitoring systems and their increasing availability in modern vehicles, further research is needed to reassess the current prevalence of drowsy driving and to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these technologies in preventing fatigue-related accidents. Falling asleep at the wheel accounts for 10–20% of automobile accidents, underlining the issue’s severity. [[19]]
- ## Sleepiness
- Experiencing sleepiness while driving increases the risk of a MVA. [[19]] [[18]] [[14]] [[6]][[3]] [[4]]. In a meta-analysis, [[3]] found that sleepiness at the wheel is associated with a significantly increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 2.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87–3.39). Importantly, the authors noted that daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) does not reflect the same type of sleepiness. Sleepiness at the wheel (SW) occurs in an active setting that demands sustained attention and high levels of alertness, while the ESS assesses sleepiness in passive, low-stimulation contexts. This discrepancy highlights the need for more nuanced and specific questionnaires. The significantly higher AUC of the Bordeaux Sleepiness Scale (BOSS) compared to that of the ESS is promising, but future research should be conducted on a broader sample of the general population to solidify its use as a preventative tool. [[19]]
- Moreover, sleep deprivation was recognized as the leading contributor to sleepiness while driving [[21]]. Drivers who slept 4–5 hours had a 4.3-fold higher crash risk than those who slept at least 7 hours, with the risk rising to 11.5 times for those sleeping less than 4 hours; [[32]] drivers with under 2 hours of sleep are considered unfit to drive (Czeisler et al., 2016). Commercial drivers and shift or night workers often have limited sleep, making them a particularly high-risk group [[6]] [[21]] [[13]]. Most studies rely on subjective measures of Total Sleep Time (TST), leaving an opportunity for objective measurements such as polysomnography (PSG) to provide more robust evidence.
- ## Fatigue
- Fatigue has shown to be a major contributor to MVAs. [[29]][[2]] [[13]] [[12]] [[6]] [[14]] Individual differences in fatigue thresholds and tolerance remain relatively poorly understood [[6]], although factors such as time of day, prior wakefulness, sleep duration, depressive mood, and task-related characteristics appear to influence them. [[22]][[6]]. Notably, a study by [[24]] found that while perceived fatigue significantly increased with prolonged driving and wakefulness, self-reported fatigue scores were not associated with the frequency of inappropriate line crossings.
- Fatigue is still a broad and vaguely-defined concept but, given its different counter-measures [[24]], warrants further research to distinguish these concepts better [[35]] [[22]]. A survey conducted among university students suggests that drowsiness should be considered a distinct construct [[35]] . Nevertheless, much of the existing literature uses the terms drowsiness and sleepiness interchangeably, often operationalizing drowsiness through ESS scores. [[2]]
- ## Sleep disorders
- Sleep disorders have been consistently associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, both of which are critical factors contributing to an increased risk of MVAs. [[29]] [[6]] Their high prevalence and the rising rate of diagnoses in the adult population in the US underscore the importance of evaluating their impact on driving risk [[6]] [[38]].
- Several studies suggest that drivers with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) have an increased risk of MVAs compared to drivers without the condition. [[1]] [[9]] [[29]] [[28]] [[4]] [[19]] Garbarino et al. found that truck drivers exhibit a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and sleep debt, with each condition independently associated with an increased risk of MVAs and near-miss accidents (NMAs). [[3]] Given that approximately one out of nine fatal traffic accidents involve trucks [[39]] , and the elevated risk factors (obesity, drinking, smoking and a lack of physical exercise) present among professional drivers, this population warrants special attention in road safety initiatives and further research focused on the identification, prevention, and management of sleep-related risks. Although some studies have found an positive correlation between Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) and accident rates, it is unclear if AHI is a good indicator of OSA severity. [[12]] [[29]] [[13]] [[12]] [[1]] Consequently, professional drivers could be unrightfully be targeted, since lawmakers and insurance companies around the globe make use of this metric.
- Insomnia is often accompanied by fatigue, reduced daytime alertness, and cognitive impairments, all of which can significantly lower quality of life [[6]] .These consequences of insomnia may contribute to accidents [[6]], and one study identified insomnia as an independent risk factor for both MVAs and NMAs [[30]] . Still, the particular element of insomnia that influences accident risk remains unknown. Moreover, primary insomnia is associated with impaired simulated driving performance in non-commerical drivers [[44]] . Additionally, many insomnia patients use hypnotics [[45]], which also seem to carry a higher MVA risk. [[4]] Given the potential risks to road safety, particularly among professional drivers who have been found to score higher on insomnia indicators, screening for signs and symptoms of insomnia is strongly recommended.
- Furthermore, research points to an increased accident risk among narcoleptic patients [[6]] [[13]] [[14]] [[29]]. Further research should be conducted on the relation between Periodic Limb Movement Disease (PLMD) and MVAs due to its scarcity. Although [[14]] haven't found an association, it is known that PLMD often induces EDS and somnolence, potentially increasing accident risk. [[6]]
- ## Age (Relevant?)
- Age appears to be associated with the occurrence of automobile accidents and may also moderate the relationship between sleep-related factors and accident risk. Some studies find younger drivers to be more at risk of MVA's than older drivers [[21]] [[26]] [[29]] [[31]] [[4]] [[2]] [[25]] [[12]] [[14]]. Importantly, driver experience, quality of health and medical conditions might have a mediating role in this effect. [[25]] Other studies suggest a second age-related peak in crash risk among older adults, who are involved in 14% of fatal crashes despite accounting for only 8% of total annual miles driven. [[25]] Perhaps frequent use of medication, along with cognitive, visual and physical impairments play a bigger role in accidents among older adults, as rates of drowsy-driving are low in persons aged ≥65, with only 4–6% having dozed-off while driving, versus 20–27% of all drivers. [[Needs ref.]]

- Perhaps frequent medication use, along with cognitive, visual, and physical impairments, may play a greater role in accidents among older adults [[25]] [[26]] , as rates of drowsy driving are relatively low in this group. Only 4–6% of persons aged ≥65 report having dozed off while driving, compared to 20–27% of drivers overall. [[26]]
- ## Previous machine learning research
- This study will investigate and analyze factors contributing to the risk of automobile accidents, with particular intrest on sleep-related influences. Previous research that aims to explore the influence of multiple aspects of sleep on accident risk via machine learning (ML) is scarce. Previous authors have used ML to detect drowsiness through facial characteristics, physiological signals and/or driving-related performance metrics. [[15]] [[16]] A recent study conducted by [[41]] aimed to develop a model to evaluate the risk of crash among self-employed truck drivers. Sleepiness and Fatigue, measured by the ESS and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) respectively, had a concerningly large presence. Several ML algorithms were tested, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) showing the most promising results (Average accuracy = 83.58%, std = .0082). Extending this approach to the general driving population would provide valuable comparative insights. A more detailed analysis of the most influential variables within the model could enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking sleep-related factors to crash risk. In the case of SVM, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) or Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explenations (LIME) are valuable tools to uncover the contribution of individual predictors. [[42]] [[43]]
- Given the multifaceted nature of sleep-related contributors to motor vehicle accidents and the limited application of machine learning, advancing our understanding of these relationships is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies and improving road safety outcomes.
