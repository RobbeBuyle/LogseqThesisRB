- ## Prevalence/ impact
- The societal and economical burden of sleep-related motor vehicle accidents (MVA) is both significant and underrecognized. [[7]] The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that roughly 100 000 road incidents occur annually around the globe due to driver sleepiness. [[21]] In the US, drowsiness while driving has an estimated annual cost of 12.4 billion dollars [[2]]
- However, it is believed that these figures are underreported underreported due to the absence of a standardised method and unspecified training for police officers to identify such types of crashes, which means the true extent of the problem may be even greater. [[28]] [[21]]
- Moreover, MVAs are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and are projected to rank as the fourth leading cause of death globally by 2030. [[3]] Given that approximately 10-33% of fatal MVAs in the US are related to sleep-related incidents [[3]] , in addition to sleep-induced crashes tending to have more severe or fatal consequence [[21]], it is crucial to better understand this relationship. [[18]] [[2]]
- ## Sleep related causes for automobile accidents
- Current literature indicates that sleep related factors contribute to MVAs in two major ways. Firstly, driving performance is significantly reduced when a persons sleep has been affected. Driving simulators are often used to evaluate driving performance in a controlled and safe environment [[21]] . Participants exhibit a significant increase in lateral lane deviations when sleep-deprived [[23]], a measure considered one of the most sensitive and important indicators of impaired driving performance under sleep deprivation [[21]][[15]]. Moreover, [[23]] found that psychomotor vigilance (PVT) was significantly impacted by sleep loss, which in turn significantly predicted certain components of simulated driving performance. Indeed, PVT lapses accounted for 9.9% of the variability in lane position, while 40% and 28% of the variance in speed variations could be predicted by PVT median RT and PVT fastest 10% accordingly. As a result, vigilance may play a crucial role in the decline of driving performance. Furthermore, a slower simulated braking response and more dangerous manoeuvers have also been observed in sleep deprived individuals. [[21]] [[22]] [[23]] Unfitting speed management has also been detected, with a significant increase in speed variability and mean speed. Interestingly, ... found that  sleep deprived individuals regularly tend to drive more slowly, presumably to compensate for their reduced vigilance. [[21]] An in-vivo experiment conducted by [[24]] yielded similar results, as sleep restriction resulted in significantly more interference from a co-pilot and inappropriate line crossings.
- Secondly, falling asleep at the wheel has been identified as a significant contributor to sleep-related MVAs. In a survey conducted by The European Sleep Research Society in 19 different European countries, 17% of participants fell asleep at the wheel at least once within 2 years. [[36]] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported a lifetime prevalence rate of 37% for individuals who have ever fallen asleep or nodded off at the wheel, according to a 2002 survey. [[37]] Given the substantial advancements in driver monitoring systems and their increasing availability in modern vehicles, further research is needed to reassess the current prevalence of drowsy driving and to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these technologies in preventing fatigue-related accidents. Falling asleep at the wheel accounts for 10–20% of automobile accidents, underlining the issue’s severity. [[19]]
- ## Sleepiness
- Sleepiness is significantly associated with MVAs. .... Importantly, a meta-analysis by [[3]] showed that daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) does not reflect the same type of sleepiness. Sleepiness at the wheel (SW) occurs in an active setting that demands sustained attention and high levels of alertness, while the ESS assesses sleepiness in passive, low-stimulation contexts. This discrepancy highlights the need for more nuanced and specific questionnaires. The Bordeaux Sleepiness Scale (BOSS) shows promising results, showing a significantly higher AUC than that of the ESS. [[19]]
