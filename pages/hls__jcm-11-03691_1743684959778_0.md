- Fatigue or sleep-related accidents have been known for a long time to be frequent causes of trafﬁc accidents in the general population [ 13 – 15], even though accidents attributable to sleepiness show an estimated rate between 10 and30% [ 13 , 16– 18 ]

- Although elderly subjects often report sleepiness, the risk for a poor driving performance associated with sleepiness is lower in old adults compared to young adults, possibly because the former tend to avoid what they perceive as dangerous situations—for example, driving at night

- he European Union Directive 2014/85/EU speciﬁcally considered the problem of OSA for issuing or renewing a driving license and took into account different safety proﬁles for commercial and non-commercial drivers [ 64], but EU Member States have adopted individual measures, and the problem of driving safety in OSA patients is currently heterogeneously addressed throughout Europe

- Since ESS scores are subjective and show many limitations, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is currently considered to be the most effective tool to study sleep propensity with regard to SW, especially if the 40 min protocol is used rather than the usual 20 min protocol

- There is growing evidence that OSA is associated with regional changes in sleep electroencephalography (EEG) pattern, reduced fMRI-measured brain connectivity or reduced functional interhemispheric connectivity [ 82, 83 ]. Azabarzin et al., recently explored the functional implications of the reduced interhemispheric sleep depth coherence for motor vehicle crash risk in middle-aged and older individuals with OSA [ 84]. The OSA patients with the highest degree of sleep depth coherence were those with a lower risk of being in an accident
