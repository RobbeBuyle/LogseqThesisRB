- The risk on abnormal driving behavior and ensuing car accidents depends on numerous factors, such as predisposing driving style and individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender) of the car-driver and intake of alcohol

- lthough drowsy drivers are as dangerous as drivers with unlawful blood alcohol levels they cannot be caught in a police checkpoint, but only in case of a perceived dangerous driving situation (Haraldsson and Akerstedt 2001)

- The non-linear models gave the best performances. Random forest and gradient boosting models both showed an accuracy 81% for the alprazolam training set, and 65% and 68% for the alcohol training set, respectivel
